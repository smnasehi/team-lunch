The code has been developed in Java and tests could be run using JUnit 4

The restaurants are ordered based on their ratings and if it's the same for two or more the one that could fulfill a larger order goes first
With this ordering the code tries to order as many high quality food as possible first  

Assumptions:
There are five types of foods each restaurant might serve: normal, vegetarian, gluten-free, nut-free, fish-free
These types are mutually exclusive 
The input to run the program (Runner.java) starts with the number restaurants, then one restaurant info per line on the consequent lines
The restaurant info looks like this: name,rating,total count,vegetarian count, gluten-free count, nut-free count, fish-free count
The last line contains the lunch order details: total count,vegetarian count, gluten-free count, nut-free count, fish-free count
If some of the special food types do not exist, 0 has to be entered

The output will list restaurants (name and rating) and the details of order for them or show a message if it's not possible to fulfill the order

A sample input/output:

2
A,5,40,4,0,0,0
B,3,100,20,20,0,0
50,5,7,0,0

Restaurant [name=A, rating=5]: MealOrder [normal:36 vegetarian:4 ]
Restaurant [name=B, rating=3]: MealOrder [normal:2 vegetarian:1 gluten_free:7 ]
